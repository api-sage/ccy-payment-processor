1) Architecture style
---------------------
- Clean architecture with dependency direction:
  - Controllers depend on usecase/service interfaces.
  - Usecases depend on repository interfaces + other service interfaces.
  - Repository implementations depend on DB and fulfill interfaces.
- Runtime wiring is in `src/cmd/server/main.go`.
- HTTP stack uses standard library (`net/http`) and shared basic-auth middleware.


2) Core domains
---------------
- User
  - Stores customer profile and transaction pin hash.
- Account
  - Customer account with `available_balance`, `ledger_balance`, status and currency.
- Transfer
  - Canonical transfer record with:
    - `transaction_reference` (client-facing reference)
    - `external_refernece` (internal/external rail reference)
    - debit/credit currencies and amounts
    - charge/vat/fx rate
    - beneficiary bank code/name and transfer status.
- Rate
  - Currency pair rates per `rate_date`.
- TransientAccount
  - Internal GL/suspense accounts:
    - Internal transient account
    - Charges account (USD)
    - VAT account (USD)
    - External GL accounts per currency (USD/GBP/EUR/NGN)
- TransientAccountTransaction
  - Audit ledger for posting entries tied to a transfer.


3) API surface (current routes)
-------------------------------
- `POST /create-user`
- `POST /verify-pin`
- `POST /create-account`
- `GET /get-account`
- `POST /deposit-funds`
- `GET /get-participant-banks`
- `GET /get-rates`
- `POST /get-rate`
- `POST /convert-fcy-amount`
- `GET /get-charges`
- `POST /transfer-funds`
- `GET /swagger`, `GET /swagger/`, `GET /swagger/openapi.json`


4) Security and validation
--------------------------
- Channel auth:
  - Basic auth via middleware (channel id/key from config).
- Transfer authorization:
  - Transaction PIN is validated through `UserService.VerifyUserPin`.
- Request validation:
  - All major request models validate format and required fields.
  - Decimal values are strongly typed (`decimal.Decimal`) end-to-end.


5) Charges and VAT model
------------------------
- Inputs: `amount`, `fromCurrency`.
- VAT:
  - Always `vatPercent * amount` in debit currency.
- Charge:
  - Evaluated in USD with min/max bounds:
    - `chargeUSD = amountUSD * chargePercent`
    - clamp to `[chargeMinUSD, chargeMaxUSD]`
  - Returned to client in debit currency:
    - for non-USD, convert final bounded USD charge back to debit currency.
- Response:
  - `amount`, `currency`, `charge`, `vat`, `sumTotal` all returned as decimal numbers.


6) Transfer orchestration
-------------------------
Single endpoint: `POST /transfer-funds`

Routing rule
- If `beneficiaryBankCode == GREY_BANK_CODE` (default `100100`): internal transfer flow.
- Else: external transfer flow.
  - Bank code must exist in in-memory participant bank list.
  - Beneficiary bank name persisted is sourced from in-memory bank data (not client payload).

Internal transfer flow
- Pre-checks:
  - validate accounts, currencies, status, PIN.
- Compute:
  - credit amount from rates, charge/vat/sum total from charges service.
- Persist transfer as `PENDING`.
- Main leg posting (single DB transaction):
  - debit sender account by `sumTotal`
  - credit internal transient by `sumTotal`
  - debit internal transient by sender principal (`debitAmount`)
  - credit beneficiary account by converted `creditAmount`
- Mark `SUCCESS`.
- Settlement leg (separate DB transaction):
  - settle fees from transient to charges/vat accounts.
- Mark `CLOSED` on settlement success.
- If settlement fails after main success:
  - return success with "Settlement pending".

External transfer flow
- Pre-checks:
  - validate debit account/currency/status/PIN.
  - validate non-internal beneficiary bank code in participant list.
  - resolve beneficiary bank name from participant list.
  - resolve destination external GL account by beneficiary currency.
- Compute:
  - `creditAmount` from rates, charge/vat/sum total from charges service.
  - generate:
    - `transaction_reference` (30 digits)
    - `external_refernece` (`EXT` + 27 digits = 30 chars total)
- Persist transfer as `PENDING`.
- Main leg posting (single DB transaction):
  - debit sender account by `sumTotal`
  - credit internal transient by `sumTotal`
  - debit internal transient by sender principal (`debitAmount`)
  - credit external GL account by converted `creditAmount`
- Mark `SUCCESS`.
- Settlement leg (separate DB transaction):
  - settle charge/vat from transient to charges/vat accounts.
- Mark `CLOSED` on settlement success.
- If settlement fails after main success:
  - return success with "Settlement pending".
- API response does not expose external reference.


7) Data consistency strategy
----------------------------
- Each posting leg is atomic (DB transaction).
- Transfer row status progression:
  - `PENDING -> SUCCESS -> CLOSED` (or `FAILED` on main-leg failure).
- Ledger and account updates are performed with guarded SQL updates
  (`rows affected` checks) to enforce:
  - account existence
  - account status
  - sufficient balances.


8) Startup behavior
-------------------
- On startup:
  - run SQL migrations from `src/migrations`.
  - ensure default rates exist (`EnsureDefaultRates`).
  - ensure transient/internal GL accounts exist (`EnsureInternalAccounts`).
- Configuration includes:
  - `GREY_BANK_CODE`
  - charge/vat percentages and bounds
  - internal transient/charges/vat account numbers
  - external USD/GBP/EUR/NGN GL account numbers.
